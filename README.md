# fast-sum-of-proper-divisors
Very very very fast way to find the sum of proper divisors using `C`.

Function for computing the sum of proper divisors is `fast_sum` at the top of [fast.c](./fast.c)
Must also include [primes.h](./primes.h) due to use of decomposition in prime factors in the algorithm.
