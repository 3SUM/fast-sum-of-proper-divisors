# fast-sum-of-proper-divisors
Very very very fast way to find the sum of proper divisors. Written in `C` for maximum speed-up.

Function for computing the sum of proper divisors is `unsigned int fast_sum(unsigned int)` located in [fast.c](./fast.c). Must also include [primes.h](./primes.h) due to the use of decomposition in prime factors in the algorithm.
